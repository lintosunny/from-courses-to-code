# You are given two lists of integers, arr1 and arr2, and a target integer value, target. 
# Your task is to find all pairs of numbers (one from arr1 and one from arr2) whose sum equals target.
# Write a function called find_pairs that takes in three arguments: arr1, arr2, and target, and returns a list of all such pairs.
# Assume that each array does not contain duplicate values.
# The tests for this exercise assume that arr1 is the list being converted to a set.
# Pairs should be returned in the order they are found while iterating through arr2.

# Input
# Your function should take in the following inputs:
# arr1: a list of integers
# arr2: a list of integers
# target: an integer

# Output
# Your function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers from arr1 and arr2 that add up to target.
# The first element of each tuple should be from arr1 and the second from arr2.

def find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target):
    # we can also use the list directly here. 
    # But the reason we convert arr1 to set1 is performance
    # python searches list one-by-one, so O(n)
    # for a set, hash table lookup, average time complexity is O(1)
    set1 = set(arr1)
    pairs = []
    for num in arr2:
        complement = target - num 
        if complement in set1:
            pairs.append((complement, num))
            
    return pairs

arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
