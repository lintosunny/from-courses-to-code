In algorithm we must get the outcome after a finite number of steps

Algorithm: how to systamatically perform a task
* write down as sequence of steps
* programming language describes the steps

Program is a sequence of steps

some steps are repeated
* do the same thing for each item in a list
    * for - for fixed number
    * while - don't know advance how many times we will repeat

some steps are executed conditionally
* do something if a value meets some requirement
